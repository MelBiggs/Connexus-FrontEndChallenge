This is my work as part of the 2020 Connexus Front-End Developer challenge. My goal is to develop an XD design into a responsive web page. 

### Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Framework Used

- Bootstrap 4 

#### Responsiveness

Using Chrome DevTools, I could simulate mobile and tablet devices with Device Mode. The page is responsive on the Moto G4, Galaxy S5, Pixel 2 & 2 XL, iPhones 5 through to 8 Plus, iPhone X, Surface Duo and Galaxy Fold. The page is also responsive on tablets should as iPad and iPad Pro. 

#### Challenges

For the *Features & Benefits* carousel for tablets and medium sized screens, I had to implement Bootstrap rows within the `carousel-item` div. This disabled the arrow navigation.

I also hoped to include the use of an npm to set up a JavaScript framework e.g. React.

I was unable to fix, or continue with, the above due to time restraints, but I have included my attempts as commented out code or as files on this project. 


Thank you for taking the time to review this project. I hope you like it!
