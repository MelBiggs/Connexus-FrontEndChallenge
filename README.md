## Introduction 

This is my work as part of the 2020 Connexus Front-End Developer challenge. My goal is to develop an XD design into a responsive web page. 

### Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Framework Used

- Bootstrap 4 

#### Responsiveness

Using Chrome DevTools, I could simulate mobile and tablet devices with Device Mode. The page is responsive on the Moto G4, Galaxy S5, Pixel 2 & 2 XL, iPhones 5 through to 8 Plus, iPhone X, Surface Duo and Galaxy Fold. The page is also responsive on tablets should as iPad and iPad Pro.
